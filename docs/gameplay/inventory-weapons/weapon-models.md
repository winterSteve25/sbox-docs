# Weapon Models

`BaseWeaponModel` marks up a weapon's `GameObject` with the points it fires from. Put it on the model prefab, assign the renderer and the attachment GameObjects, and the weapon holding it finds everything through there.

## View and world models

A weapon has two looks. The view model renders for the holding player in first person, and the world model attaches to the holder's hand bone (`HoldBone`) for everyone else. Assign `ViewModelPrefab` and `WorldModelPrefab` on the weapon, each with a BaseWeaponModel on it.

`HoldType` and `Handedness` on the weapon set how the holder carries it. They drive the "holdtype" parameters on the holder's animgraph, so the citizen stands right with a pistol, a rifle or nothing at all.

## Attachments

`MuzzleGameObject` marks where shots come from and `ShellEjectGameObject` where brass comes out. They're just empty GameObjects placed on the model.

## Effects

Muzzle flash, brass eject and tracers come with default prefabs, so shots look right with zero setup. Swap them per weapon with the `MuzzleEffect`, `EjectBrass` and `TracerEffect` properties, or clear them to have none.

## Animation

The model reacts to the weapon through hooks, and the base ones set animgraph parameters: deploying sets `b_deploy`, attacking sets `b_attack` and plays the effects, reloading sets `b_reload`. Override `OnDeploy`, `OnAttack`, `OnReloadStart` etc in a subclass when your rig wants something else.

There are ready made first person arms and weapons you can use: [First Person Weapons](/assets/ready-to-use-assets/first-person-weapons.md).
