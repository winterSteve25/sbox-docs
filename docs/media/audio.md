## MusicPlayer

`MusicPlayer` is for music tracks and streaming audio that need programmatic control over playback, positioning, or visualization. For in-game sound effects and Sound components, see [Sound](../sound/index.md).

```csharp
var music = MusicPlayer.Play( FileSystem.Mounted, "music/theme.ogg" );
music.Volume = 0.8f;
music.Repeat = true;
```

Streaming from a URL:

```csharp
var music = MusicPlayer.PlayUrl( "https://example.com/stream.ogg" );
```

By default, `MusicPlayer` plays globally. To place it in world-space:

```csharp
music.ListenLocal = false;
music.Position = WorldPosition;
```

Audio visualization:

```csharp
ReadOnlySpan<float> spectrum = music.Spectrum;   // 512-element FFT magnitudes
float amplitude = music.Amplitude;               // approximate loudness
```
