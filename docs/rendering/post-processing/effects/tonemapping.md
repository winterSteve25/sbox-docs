# Tonemapping

# What is it

In s&box, tonemapping is a built-in post-processing effect that remaps HDR colors for display, which by default can appear dark until tuned. You can run other post-processing effects before or after tonemapping to use a full HDR buffer, or to use the resulting LDR buffer respectively.

s&box supports multiple different tonemappers, each with different ways of mapping HDR content to LDR, which affect the appearance of your scene. You can pick whichever you prefer.

## How to use it

On your camera GameObject, add a Tonemapping component.

## Properties

The s&box tonemapping component supports the following properties:

* **Mode**: the tonemapping operator algorithm (e.g., Reinhard, ACES).
* **Auto Exposure**
  * **Auto Exposure Enabled**: toggles automatic exposure adaptation.
  * **Minimum Exposure**: lower bound for exposure when auto exposure is active.
  * **Maximum Exposure**: upper bound for exposure when auto exposure is active.
  * **Exposure Compensation**: offset applied on top of the calculated exposure.
  * **Rate**: speed at which exposure adapts to scene brightness changes.

## Modes

The s&box tonemapping component has the following modes available:

### Hable Filmic ![Hable Filmic on Construct with default exposure settings](./images/hable-filmic-on-construct-with-default-exposure-settings.png)

Source 2's default tonemapper. Preserves detail in dark areas well, but loses punchiness in brighter areas.




### ACES ![ACES on Construct with default exposure settings](./images/aces-on-construct-with-default-exposure-settings.png)

Filmic, very punchy, and has very high levels of contrast.





### Reinhard-Jodie ![Reinhard-Jodie on Construct with default exposure settings](./images/reinhard-jodie-on-construct-with-default-exposure-settings.png)

Low contrast, but good for most environments.





### Linear ![Linear on Construct with default exposure settings](./images/linear-on-construct-with-default-exposure-settings.png)

Unbiased and only applies exposure.





### AgX ![AgX on Construct with default exposure settings](./images/agx-on-construct-with-default-exposure-settings.png)

The same tonemapper used by Blender. Similar saturation and detail to ACES, but lifts darker areas slightly more. Great for outdoor areas.
