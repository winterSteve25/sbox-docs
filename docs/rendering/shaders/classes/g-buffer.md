# G-Buffer

Materials that write to Depth PrePass also write to a G-Buffer, if you are using the standard ShadingModel, you just have to make sure you have a `Depth();` mode enabled.

It contains minimal information about the object before we do the lighting pass, like it's Normals and Roughness, it can be used in post-processing to do all sorts of effects like accurate Ambient Occlusion and Screen-Space Reflections.

You can sample the G-Buffer in any shader with:

```cpp
float3 Normals::Sample( int2 ScreenPosition )
```

```cpp
float3 Roughness::Sample( int2 ScreenPosition )
```

If the object in that texel does not write to the G-buffer, then it reconstructs normal maps from it

## Writing to G-Buffer 

You can write to G-Buffer yourself, if you are writing your own custom shading model, or need to do this for any other reason. Just like it's mentioned above, make sure your shader has `Depth()` mode enabled.

```cpp
if( DepthNormal::WantsDepthNormal() )
    return DepthNormal::Output( float3 Normal, float Roughness, float Opacity );
```

* `DepthNormals::WantsDepthNormals()` will check if we're in the appropriate mode for writing to g-buffer. (depth prepass, `S_MODE_DEPTH == 1`)
* `float3 Normal` must be a world-space normal vector in **(-1 to 1)** range
* Red, green and blue channels are reserved for the normals, and alpha is for roughness/opacity. By default, g-buffer will write normals (RGB channels) and roughness (alpha)
* `float Roughness` and `float Opacity` are optional, if they're skipped then g-buffer will set roughness/opacity to **1** 

If your shader has **alpha test** enabled, (defined by `S_ALPHA_TEST` combo) then `Output` will write normals (RGB) and **opacity** (alpha) instead of roughness.
